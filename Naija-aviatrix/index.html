    <h1>Naija Aviatrix</h1>
    <p><strong>Naija Aviatrix</strong> originally named Fun Loving Flying ladies was created and formed as a WhatsApp group by <em>Captain Mercy Odushola Eghonghon</em> in Novmber 2014.
        These <i>group of Nigerian <strong>female pilots</strong> united by their desire to break boundaries and change the norm are not only fun loving lady aviators, they have untited against all odds to bring change, aid, awereness and support to all around them.
        Over the years, these ladies have contributed to raising funds from within themselves for those in need and they did not stop even through the hard times of the corona invasion. 
    Their big heart for others, their generosity and intergrity in helping the needy, is what has lead to the growth of their membership to over sixty female pilots.
They do not intend to stop here. A lot have them have lost their jobs but they intend on continuing the good work by offering mentorship to boys and girls alike. With partnerships and sponsors, they are also able to continue to do more.</i></p>
